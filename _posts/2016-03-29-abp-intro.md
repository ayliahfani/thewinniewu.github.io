Introduction
==========================

Two days ago, I was passing through Harvard Square on my way back to Quincy when I walked by ABP next to the Smith Center. To my horror, there was a sign taped on the door:

>"This location is closing
<br>Thursday March 31st
<br>Thank you for 32 great years"

We knew it was coming with the construction going on in the Smith/Holyoke Center, but I was secretly hoping that ABP would be spared an eviction until at least after I graduated. 

The reason for this is centered around one very special pastry close to my heart: The Chocolate Croissant.

Technically, what ABP labels as its Chocolate Croissant is actually a Pain au Chocolate, since it is not of the crescent shaped-variety. Naming aside though, with its generous sizing, perfect flakiness, and beautifully presented icing sugar and syrup decor, at $2.35 it was the best deal for such chocolatey goodness in the Square. 

Every Monday after classes, I would make it a point to drop into ABP and order this perfection-in-a-pastry, alongside a $1.99 latte (also generously priced!). However, this week, I knew it would be my last. Lo and behold, when I entered to get my weekly croissant, I was dismayed to find that it was not stocked at all :( I attributed this to less stock as the store wound down for its final day.

This series is dedicated to the most value chocolate croissant in Harvard Square and my search for a replacement. I hope that ABP will be able to find a new location in the Square to continue its 32 year service to poor college students who appreciate non-compromised baked goods for a reasonable price.  

For your information, here is the nutritional information about the ABP chocolate croissant ([source](http://aubonpain.com/menu/chocolate-croissant-0)).
