Starbucks
==========================

_This is part of a multi-part review series, read the motivation [here](../../03/29/abp-intro.html)._

So I have unsuccessfully sought out chocolate croissants for the last few days. Here is a list of places I tried to look for chocolate croissants and could not find them:

<ul>
<li> Barker Cafe </li>
<li> Cafe Pamplona </li>
<li> Design School Cafe </li>
<li> Crema Cafe </li>
</ul>

It could just be that these places sold out or didn't stock them on the day I went. Still, reiterates my frustration with ABP closing :(

This afternoon, I popped into Peet's to see if they stocked chocolate croissants after being unsuccessful at Crema (by the way, Crema's website clearly prices their chocolate croissants at $3.15, which implies that they are stocked at least sometimes. I'll have to check back again later I guess).

Even on the shelf, the croissant looked a loooot smaller (even smaller than Starbucks'). At least, labelled at $2.45, it was cheaper. Still, given that ABP's croissant is 55% bigger than Peet's, I wasn't impressed. At the register, the price of the chocolate croissant actually came to $2.35, which was better for me but also somewhat confusing. I guess it's a better 1:1 comparison with ABP's though, since they were the same price in reality.

My impressions of the croissant were:
<ul>
<li> Tiny </li>
<li> Filling to 'pastry' (in quotation marks because of my next point) ratio was disappointing </li>
<li> 'Pastry' was not actually pastry. Croissants are denoted by their use of puff pastry (otherwise it's not really a croissant). This object was decidedly more bready than pastry-like. It was definitely springier than it was flaky, as you can probably tell from the photos below...</li>
<li> No embellishments (icing sugar or syrup :c)</li>
</ul>

Look how bready the inside of this 'croissant' is ._.
