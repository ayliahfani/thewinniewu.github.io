<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Two days ago, I was passing through Harvard Square on my way back to Quincy when I walked by ABP next to the Smith Center. To my horror, there was a sign taped on the door:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúThis location is closing
<br />Thursday March 31st
<br />Thank you for 32 great years‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We knew it was coming with the construction going on in the Smith/Holyoke Center, but I was secretly hoping that ABP would be spared an eviction until at least after I graduated.</p>

<p>The reason for this is centered around one very special pastry close to my heart: The Chocolate Croissant.</p>

<p>Technically, what ABP labels as its Chocolate Croissant is actually a Pain au Chocolate, since it is not of the crescent shaped-variety. Naming aside though, with its generous sizing, perfect flakiness, and beautifully presented icing sugar and syrup decor, at $2.35 it was the best deal for such chocolatey goodness in the Square.</p>

<p>Every Monday after classes, I would make it a point to drop into ABP and order this perfection-in-a-pastry, alongside a $1.99 latte (also generously priced!). However, this week, I knew it would be my last. Lo and behold, when I entered to get my weekly croissant, I was dismayed to find that it was not stocked at all :( I attributed this to less stock as the store wound down for its final day.</p>

<p>This series is dedicated to the most value chocolate croissant in Harvard Square and my search for a replacement. I hope that ABP will be able to find a new location in the Square to continue its 32 year service to poor college students who appreciate non-compromised baked goods for a reasonable price.</p>

<p>For your information, here is the nutritional information about the ABP chocolate croissant (<a href="http://aubonpain.com/menu/chocolate-croissant-0">source</a>).</p>
