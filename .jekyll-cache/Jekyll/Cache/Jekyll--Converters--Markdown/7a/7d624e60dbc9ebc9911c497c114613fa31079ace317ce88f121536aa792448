<p><em>This is part of a multi-part review series, read the motivation <a href="abp-intro.html">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>I chose to go to Starbucks today after dropping into the Peets in the Capital One Cafe and discovering that they did not stock Chocolate Croissants this week. They did have a strange looking square almond croissant and a pecan sticky bun that didn’t look quite as good as Flour’s, but still pretty good (an aside, Flour has also sold out of sticky buns the last two times I went =_=). However, I was bent on having my weekly chocolate croissant so I opted to go around the corner and look in Starbucks. I have had Starbucks’ chocolate croissants before, but not in the Harvard Square location.</p>

<p>I asked for it to be warmed up. My impressions of the croissant were:</p>
<ul>
<li> More expensive </li>
<li>Noticeably smaller </li>
<li> Filling was not centered </li>
<li>Pastry didn't look browned enough / not enough egg wash used before bake </li>
<li> Sunken in the middle </li>
<li> No embellishments (icing sugar or syrup :c)</li>
</ul>

<p>
Basically inferior to its ABP equivalent in every way, so the hunt continues :/
</p>

<p>Priced at $2.75 before tax, the Starbucks chocolate croissant is 12% more expensive than ABP’s. It is also less than 70% of the size of an ABP croissant. What a travesty :( Even the picture looks sad (<a href="http://www.starbucks.com/menu/food/bakery/chocolate-croissant">source</a>):</p>
