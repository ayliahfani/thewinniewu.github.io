<p><em>This is part of a multi-part review series, read the motivation <a href="../../03/29/abp-intro.html">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>So I have unsuccessfully sought out chocolate croissants for the last few days. Here is a list of places I tried to look for chocolate croissants and could not find them:</p>

<ul>
<li> Barker Cafe </li>
<li> Cafe Pamplona </li>
<li> Design School Cafe </li>
<li> Crema Cafe </li>
</ul>

<p>It could just be that these places sold out or didnâ€™t stock them on the day I went. Still, reiterates my frustration with ABP closing :(</p>

<p>This afternoon, I popped into Peetâ€™s to see if they stocked chocolate croissants after being unsuccessful at Crema (by the way, Cremaâ€™s website clearly prices their chocolate croissants at $3.15, which implies that they are stocked at least sometimes. Iâ€™ll have to check back again later I guess).</p>

<p>Even on the shelf, the croissant looked a loooot smaller (even smaller than Starbucksâ€™). At least, labelled at $2.45, it was cheaper. Still, given that ABPâ€™s croissant is 55% bigger than Peetâ€™s, I wasnâ€™t impressed. At the register, the price of the chocolate croissant actually came to $2.35, which was better for me but also somewhat confusing. I guess itâ€™s a better 1:1 comparison with ABPâ€™s though, since they were the same price in reality.</p>

<p>My impressions of the croissant were:</p>
<ul>
<li> Tiny </li>
<li> Filling to 'pastry' (in quotation marks because of my next point) ratio was disappointing </li>
<li> 'Pastry' was not actually pastry. Croissants are denoted by their use of puff pastry (otherwise it's not really a croissant). This object was decidedly more bready than pastry-like. It was definitely springier than it was flaky, as you can probably tell from the photos below...</li>
<li> No embellishments (icing sugar or syrup :c)</li>
</ul>

Look how bready the inside of this â€˜croissantâ€™ is ._.</p>
