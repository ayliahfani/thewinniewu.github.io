# Content for about page.
# Each paragraph will be a <p> tag which is inserted to about
# page. text_align is used to align the text. Default is left.
# Other two values are center and right. If there are some links
# in your paragraph, use '?link?' to take the place of a link.
# And then write the real link under links. name is the link
# text. url is the link. when external is set as true, then
# a new whidow will be open when link is clicked.
